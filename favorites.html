    <h1>I'm very boring :(</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>
        I like to exercise. I play many sports like basketball, badminton, weightlifting,
        dragonboat, and cardio. Recently, I've been doing a lot of dragonboat.
        I paddle for a team called DCH. There are many divisions like Men's,
        Women's, Juniors, and Mixed. I'm on the junior boat because I'm under
        18. Here's some pictures and videos. </strong
